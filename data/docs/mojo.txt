Mojo Programming: Basic to Medium Level Guide
1. What is Mojo?

Mojo is a high-performance programming language designed for AI and systems programming. It was introduced by Modular with the goal of combining:

🐍 Python-like simplicity

⚡ C/C++-level performance

🔬 Strong support for AI and ML workloads

Mojo is especially powerful for developers who want speed without sacrificing readability.

🌱 Part 1: Basics of Mojo
1. Hello World
fn main():
    print("Hello, Mojo!")


fn defines a function.

main() is the program entry point.

Syntax feels very similar to Python.

2. Variables and Types

Mojo supports both dynamic and static typing.

Dynamic Style (Python-like)
x = 10
name = "Mojo"

Static Type (Recommended for Performance)
let x: Int = 10
let pi: Float64 = 3.14159


let → immutable variable

var → mutable variable

Example:

var counter: Int = 0
counter += 1

3. Functions
fn add(a: Int, b: Int) -> Int:
    return a + b


Parameter types must be declared.

Return type comes after ->.

4. Control Flow
If-Else
fn check(num: Int):
    if num > 0:
        print("Positive")
    else:
        print("Non-positive")

Loops
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

var i = 0
while i < 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1

🚀 Part 2: Medium-Level Concepts
5. Structs (Like Classes but Lightweight)
struct Person:
    var name: String
    var age: Int

fn main():
    var p = Person("Pranjal", 20)
    print(p.name)


struct is efficient and memory-safe.

Useful for performance-critical programs.

6. Ownership & Memory Safety

Mojo introduces ownership concepts (inspired by Rust).

Example:

fn process(value: Int):
    print(value)


Mojo ensures:

No accidental memory leaks

Better performance

Safe parallelism

7. Performance Features

Mojo allows low-level optimizations:

Explicit memory control

SIMD support

GPU acceleration

Compile-time metaprogramming

Example of strongly typed optimized code:

fn multiply(a: Int, b: Int) -> Int:
    return a * b


Static typing enables faster compilation and execution.

8. Python Interoperability

One of Mojo’s strongest features:

You can import and use Python libraries directly.

from python import Python

fn main():
    let math = Python.import_module("math")
    print(math.sqrt(16))


This makes transition easy for developers already comfortable with Python.

🎯 When to Use Mojo?

Mojo is ideal for:

AI/ML model acceleration

Writing high-performance numerical code

Systems-level programming

Replacing slow Python bottlenecks

🧠 Learning Path Recommendation

If you're starting out:

Master basic syntax (variables, loops, functions).

Practice structs and typed functions.

Learn ownership & memory model.

Explore performance optimization features.

Build small AI-focused utilities.

🔥 Final Thought

Mojo bridges the gap between ease of Python and power of C++.
If you’re into AI, systems, or performance engineering, Mojo is worth learning.
